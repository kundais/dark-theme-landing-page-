in the last project i built, i said my next goal was to improve my flexbox skills... well this project improved them by 110% i used flexbox through out, and learnt a lot from it. not only was this a fun project but it really taught me how to look at a design and try implement exactly what i see into my code.
the challenge was by front-end mentor.
